# Automation Project using Java + Selenium (This project is not finished)

This project uses Java and Selenium to develop automation scripts for testing. The test cases are written in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) style using Cucumber for interpretation.

## Design Pattern
This project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to enhance test maintenance and reduce code duplication.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Programming language used for writing the test scripts.
- **Selenium**: WebDriver for automating web applications for testing purposes.
- **Cucumber**: Framework for writing test cases in BDD style.
- **JUnit**: Test runners for executing the tests (choose one based on your setup).
- **Maven**: Build tools for managing project dependencies and build lifecycle.

## Running the Tests
To execute the tests, use the following commands:

If you are using Maven:
mvn test
